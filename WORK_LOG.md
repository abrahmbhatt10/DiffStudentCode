| Feb 25 | 11:25 - 11:55am |                                                                                                                                                   I tried brainstorming. I created a few of the basic checks. I did this using if conditions. |
| Feb 26 | 9:30 - 10:00pm  |                                                                                                                                                               I created a method. I initialized an array. The array had matches of positions. |
| Feb 26 | 10:00 - 10:30pm |                                                                               The second function started to get the sublength. It did this based on the matches positions. I need to create another 2-d array to store the sublength values. |
| Feb 27 |  10:30 - 11:00  |                                                          I tried to implement Mr. Blick's suggestion. His suggestion was to have only 1 number below each character in String 1. Through examples, I realized I needed to save all positions. |
| Feb 27 |  11:00 - 11:30  |                                                                          I implemented a tabulation table. The table was saving substring values. At each position of the string, I was using previouslength to calculate new string lengths. |
| Feb 27 |    3:30 - 4     |                                                                                                                                                 I tested the code. All tests were passing. Efficient largest was taking 7 minutes 36 seconds. |
| Feb 27 |    5 - 5:30     |                                                                                         I revised the code. I tried implementing Mr. Blick's suggestion. I stopped searching for string lengths smaller than previouslength at a given round. |
| Feb 28 |    5 - 5:30     |                                                                                                                                         I tried implementing memoization first. I did this using Mr. Blick's slides. I used them to guide me. |
| Feb 28 |    5:30 - 6     |                                                                                            I then implemented tabulation. I also used the pseudocode from his slides. I also understood how to implement from the explanation given in class. |
| Mar 3  |   9:00 - 9:30   |                                                                                                                           I tried to attempt the challenge. The challenge was to return the longest substring(s). However, I could not do it. |
| Mar 4  |    9 - 9:30     | I wrote comments for tabulation. I had to delete the methods for the challenge, as they were interfering with the code. I also deleted a class that helped me do the challenge, as it interfered with the tabulation code negatively as well. |
